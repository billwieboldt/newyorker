## New Yorker Stylesheet

New Yorker was originally going to be solely based on the type and colors from The New Yorker, but then I went a little overboard. This stylesheet is responsive; resize your browser or visit on your phone and you won't be stuck with a fixed-width experience.

Note that I'm doing some pretty weird stuff to achieve some of my goals, so this style is best viewed in Chrome. While functional in Firefox, you'll miss some of the prettier effects.

There are some cutesy things; if someone doesn't have an avatar, their empty avatar is replaced by a 'random' illustration from The New Yorker. Many extra colors are hidden until you hover over table rows. Tags are each given a color and that color is used consistently across the site. For the requests section in particular, tags referring to availability on systems such as OverDrive have an additional icon before the text to make them easier to ID at a glance.

#### Caveats:

- A few pages aren't mobile-friendly. When options conflicted, I sided with the more likely to be used pages.

- The header title is a single color in Firefox and some default icons are not replaced with FontAwesome icons.

- Areas of the site that I cannot see, such as staff tools may be ugly.

- There are some inline dots/separators that I can't get rid of at this time.

- If you want a dark theme, this isn't the theme for you.

- If you don't like unexpected bits of color, this isn't the theme for you.

- If you hide the front page sidebar, things may break.

- I prefer to host stylesheets on my server so that any changes can be shared without needing a new whatimg URL. If you'd prefer a static mirror, feel free to grab the CSS and host it; note that there are @import URLs at the top that contain webfont data.

- If there are features about this you'd like to change in your own spinoff, the easiest way would be to use an @import and list your own modifications underneath.
